        Every one of the people getting involved in the Warm Hearts
        initiative—volunteers, families, children, and the whole 
        community—may see major impacts. How to go about this is as follows:
    </p>
        
    <section>
        <div class="bubble">
            <h3><b><u>IMPACT ON CHILDREN</u></b></h3>
            <p><b>BETTER HEALTH:</b> 
                Thin winter jackets protect kids from cold weather,
                reducing the risk of infections like flu, pneumonia, and colds, 
                promoting healthier children's involvement and energy.
            </p>
            <p><b>INCREASE IN SCHOOL ATTENDANCE:</b> 
                Dressing appropriately for the cold can
                increase school attendance, keeping students on track with their homework 
                and ensuring they don't miss out on educational opportunities.
            </p>
            <p><b>BOOSTED SELF-ESTEEM:</b>
                Having a warm coat allows children to feel secure
                and cared for, which can improve their self-confidence and overall well-being.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bubble">
            <h3><b><u>IMPACT ON FAMILIES</u></b></h3>
            <p><b>FINANCIAL RELIEF:</b> 
                The cost of winter clothing can be a 
                significant burden for families that are already having difficulty making ends 
                meet. Warm Hearts lifts families of this financial burden by giving away free 
                coats, freeing up funds for other essentials like food, housing, or education.
            </p>
            <p><b>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT:</b> 
                Having a sense of being accepted
                and comfort from knowing that their community is behind them can help reduce
                the stress that comes with financial difficulties.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="bubble">
            <h3><b><u>IMPACT ON OVERALL SOCIETY</u></b></h3>
            <p><b>DECREASE IN INEQUALITY:</b> 
                Warm Hearts aims to decrease the differences between
                those who can afford these needs and those who cannot by making sure that all 
                children have access to necessary winter clothes.
            </p>
            <p><b>INCREASED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION:</b> 
                By inspiring more people to take part in 
                charity activities, this initiative may aid in the growth of a more caring, 
                active, and engaged society.
            </p>
            <p><b>POSITIVE RIPPLE EFFECT:</b>
                When children develop and families feel at 
                ease, the positive effects flow to all areas of the community, making it 
                healthier and more active overall. Warm Hearts can help everyone by improving
                the health and education of children, improving the financial situation of families, 
                providing volunteers meaningful opportunities, and creating a more solid, 
                stronger community.
